## Overview

Welcome to the Pathfinder Visualization Tool! This web application allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. It's an interactive tool that provides insights into how algorithms navigate through different obstacles to find the shortest path.

Access the live tool: [Pathfinder Visualization Tool](https://pathfinder-algo-visual.netlify.app/#)

## Features

- **Algorithm Support:** Currently supports Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm.
- **Interactive Grid:** Users can customize grid dimensions, add barriers, and observe real-time pathfinding visualization.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices.

## How to Use

1. Access the live tool [here](https://pathfinder-algo-visual.netlify.app/#).
2. Customize the grid by adjusting dimensions and adding barriers.
3. Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4. Click "Visualize Path" to see the algorithm in action.
5. Watch as the tool dynamically illustrates the exploration and selection of nodes during the pathfinding process.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm
